I played around with some steganography tools  but it didn't feel like hiding when you click click click everything.
A good list of products that can be used by non computer techies. Note that most of them actually hide data and "encrypt" it.

Steganography can be done without using fancy tools and can be even hidden in anyday  files and "objects" 
I just wanted to test out how easy it is to hide data in the daylight by just playing around with everyday tools.


All you need is open source tools readily available on Linux and Windows to do to actually hide stuff.. 
You can get inventive! 




Scroll Down to see info and get more hints about each flag

There are 5 flags to be found within 3 files. Of course I could have hidden even more flags to show each trait about each filetype
and how metadata (HINT HINT HINT) works. But It's enough for now:)
Each file format has something specific about it that can be (ab)used...

I had some theories about how to hide data and wanted to try them out and it seems they all worked!

Each flag is hidden within a file 
The file may be or may not be directly viewable, search for it:)
There is NO encryption and no need to brute force so don;t worry about that.
I didn't use any special program to hide the data in the least significant bit or anything like that.
So there is no interposing of data otherwise it wouldn't have been fun:)

The recommended way is the following:
- Audio 1 flag
- Image 2 flags	
- Document 2 flags




This readme has hints... you can solve it without the hints.. if you get stuck.. just read the hints by scrolling down




I hope you'll have fun figuring out things the way I had fun hidding them

GET THE FLAG!  Audio (1 flag)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was working  on my next big hit but before I could get coffee my cat sat on my MacBook FullOfAir Pro  
so my Platinum Album got corrupted can y'all fix it?
Fearing that Aliens might have brainwashed my Cat I hid the file somewhere and now can't find it back!
I think i might have renamed the extension to something else! I heard that open source formats are better.. 
Renaming it converts it, right?
Can you find the flag?:D


















































HINT: It's an audio file.. did you try searching for all audio files?







































HINT: It might be hidden somewhere in with the system files..







































HINT: Found it? Great.. Now listen to it and try to hear the voice.  It doesn't seem to be the voice I registered :( 






























HINT: You might have noticed that speeding it up doesn't work :D and it's still inaudible, dont bother speeding it up with other programs. thats not the thing

















































HINT: Bada Boom Hertz ! Hertz it More ! Higher and Higher!  Audacity might help




See what we did here? Well, I could have used multiple channels and actually made it so when you change the channel you can
hear something else but that goes waay to far and it too time consuming.. butyou can hide data well.

























~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GET THE FLAG! Vikings Style (contains 2 flags)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It seems that some vikings took my precious diamond and left me with a picture of them on my background.. can you help me find it back?




































HINT: Yeah, they might have put it in a bag, inside of a trunk.. 








































HINT Think about inception.  Didn't see the movie? Ok.. how about you read about Matryoshka doll's :D








































HINT: use a hex viewer to extract what you need...







































HINT use trid (just saying... you can also work on Linux for extracting the data and just use "file")







































HINT flag 2:  can you guess the Exchangeable Image File ?






































HINT flag 2: It's encoded ... pretty easy to figure it out, right?










~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GET THE FLAG!  Huckleberry Finn (2 flags)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mark Twain is a great author for children's books
Can you find the hidden flags inside the story? 
But first can you locate the hidden file?

















































HINT: But there's nothing in the C: man, where is it! Is it on another partition or disk? 





































HINT: Read the story and you will find the flag.







































HINT: Didn't find it with CTRL+F yet?  You could sure use some magnifying glass...

















































HINT flag 2: What;s special about DOCX ...? Read about it on Wikipedia
























































HINT FLAG 2:  Finn didn't have modern jeans with zipped pants.. But he still managed to hide the flag on an inside pocket
